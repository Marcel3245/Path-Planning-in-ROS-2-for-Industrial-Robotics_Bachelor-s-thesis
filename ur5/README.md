# Project Core (`UR5`)

This directory (`UR5`) serves as the core repository for the project's code, encompassing the UR5 robot description and the main system logic. The codebase is organized into standard ROS 2 packages.

As outlined in the official ROS 2 documentation, packages are fundamental organizational units for ROS 2 code, facilitating installation, sharing, and distribution.

Within the `UR5` directory, you will find the following seven packages, each prefixed with `mycobot_` for naming consistency:

1.  **`mycobot_description`**
    This package contains the detailed description of the UR5 robot. It includes:
    *   `config`: Robot-specific configuration files (kinematics, joint limits, etc.).
    *   `meshes`: Visual and collision geometry files for the robot links.
    *   `urdf`: The Unified Robot Description Format file that combines all the robot's properties into a single description.

    ```
    mycobot_description/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meshes/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ urdf/
    ```

2.  **`mycobot_gazebo`**
    This package defines the Gazebo simulation environment for the project:
    *   `config`: Configuration related to the ROS-Gazebo bridge communication.
    *   `models`: Description files (visual, collision, parameters) for objects used *only* within the Gazebo simulation (e.g., workpieces, tables).
    *   `worlds`: Files defining the Gazebo world parameters, including the environment layout, static objects, GUI settings, gravity, etc.

    ```
    mycobot_gazebo/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worlds/
    ```

3.  **`mycobot_gripper_description`**
    Contains the specific description for the Robotiq gripper used with the UR5:
    *   `meshes`: Visual and collision geometry files for the gripper links.
    *   `urdf`: The URDF file describing the gripper.

    ```
    mycobot_gripper_description/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meshes/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ urdf/
    ```

4.  **`mycobot_moveit`**
    This is the MoveIt configuration package for the UR5. MoveIt is a powerful framework providing tools for motion planning, manipulation, perception, kinematics, control, and navigation:
    *   `config`: Important configuration data for MoveIt's path planning and the robot setup.
    *   `srdf`: The Semantic Robot Description Format file, which complements the URDF by adding information about robot poses, collision pairs to ignore, and groups of joints.
    *   `.setup_assistant`: Files generated by the MoveIt Setup Assistant tool, which helps define the final MoveIt configuration for the robot.

    ```
    mycobot_moveit/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ srdf/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .setup_assistant/
    ```

5.  **`mycobot_mtc`**
    Houses the implementation of the MoveIt Task Constructor (MTC) logic. MTC is used to define and plan complex robot tasks broken down into interdependent subtasks:
    *   `launch`: Stores ROS 2 launch files for starting different components or the entire system configuration.
    *   `rviz`: Configuration files for the RViz visualization interface, including panel layouts and displays.
    *   `src`: Source code files implementing the MTC task sequence and logic.

    ```
    mycobot_mtc/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launch/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rviz/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ```

6.  **`mycobot_opencv`**
    Contains the ROS 2 node(s) and configuration related to object detection using the OpenCV library:
    *   `mycobot_opencv`: Directory likely containing the source code and specific launch/configuration files for the OpenCV node responsible for camera processing and object detection.

    ```    mycobot_opencv/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mycobot_opencv/ 
    ```
    *(Note: The internal structure of the `mycobot_opencv` subdirectory may vary.)*

7.  **`mycobot_ros2`**
    This package serves as a fundamental organizational unit for general ROS 2 code within the project. It might contain common utilities, base nodes, or components not specific to description, simulation, or planning. (The specific contents would depend on the project's design).

Each of these packages typically adheres to a standard ROS 2 directory structure, including these key elements:

*   **`CMakeLists.txt`**: Defines how to build the source code within the package.
*   **`package.xml`**: Contains essential meta-information about the package, such as dependencies, version, author, and description.
*   **`include/<package_name>`**: Directory designated for public header files that other packages might need to include.
*   **`src`**: Directory containing the primary source code files (e.g., `.cpp` for C++, `.py` for Python).

A typical structure for a basic ROS 2 package looks like this:
