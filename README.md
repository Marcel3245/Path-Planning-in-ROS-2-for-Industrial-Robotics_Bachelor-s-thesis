# Bachelor's thesis: Path Planning in ROS 2 for Industrial Robotics

An integrated ROS 2 system for automated, collision-free path planning for a Universal Robot 5 (UR5). Utilizes MoveIt for motion planning, Gazebo for simulation, and RViz for visualization. Incorporates OpenCV for basic object detection to dynamically update the planning scene from camera input, enabling more responsive path planning. Trajectories are validated in Gazebo to ensure safety and correctness, aiming to automate path generation and reduce manual programming in industrial robotics.
